# ABCD_Internalizing
Internalizing Study with ABCD data

Neuroimaging Data
The ABCD image acquisition protocol includes structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task  functional MRI data. Exclusion criteria for the ABCD StudyÂ® are documented elsewhere (Casey et al., 2018; Auchter et al., 2018; Garavan et al., 2018). We excluded participants with low-quality control scores on their MRIs were excluded from all modalities.  
sMRI
Structural data included cortical thickness (mean thickness per ROI), cortical surface area (total surface area per ROI), and subcortical volume (total gray matter volume) from regions defined by the Destriux atlas(Destrieux et al., 2010)
DTI
DTI assesses water diffusion in biological tissue to assess micro-structural changes in white matter architecture. From these data, fractional anisotropy (FA) are computed and reflecting directionality estimates of tissue characteristics like myelination, fiber density etc. DTI data were also captured by the Destriux atlas with 151 regions. Also, Average fractional anisotropy within DTI atlas tract with 42 regions were also measured.

rsMRI
Resting-state activity for a duration of 20 minutes was collected. Resting-state ROIs were parcellated using Gordon parcels (Gordon et al., 2016) Average time courses were calculated for each ROI. ROIs were grouped together according to the Gordon parcellations networks (e.g.,default-mode network, fronto-parietal). Average pairwise ROI correlations were computed within and between each network. There were 91 cortical (78 inter- and 13 intra-network correlations) and 316 cortical to subcortical network correlations.
